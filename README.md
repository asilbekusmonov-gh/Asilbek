Hi there! This is my very first project uploaded to GitHub. I’ve been studying Python, and I built this to practice how a backend communicates with a database.
🐘 What is this?

This is a simple CRUD application. Instead of using a framework that does everything for me, I used psycopg2 to write raw SQL. I wanted to see exactly how data moves between my code and PostgreSQL.
